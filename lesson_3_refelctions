When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when I finish a new feature and sending multiple commits at the same time to make them public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I pull changes manually because sometimes I only need to pull updates from certain branch to local repository rather than automatically 
pulling all the updates from he remote repository.
